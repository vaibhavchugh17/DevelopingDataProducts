Introduction

* Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?
* Was it 5 pages?
* Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?

About the app
========================================================
We all love scatter plots. So I took this opportunity to provide an interface to the user to understand how scatter plots work,
by giving the ability to select x-range and y-range for both the axes which the user can set and see how it works.
